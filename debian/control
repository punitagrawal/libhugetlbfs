Description: Development files to build programs using libhugetlbfs
 libhugetlbfs is a library which provides easy access to huge pages of
 memory. It is a wrapper for the hugetlbfs file system. Applications
 can use huge pages to fulfill malloc() requests without being
 recompiled by using LD_PRELOAD. Alternatively, applications can be
 linked against libhugetlbfs without source modifications to load text
 or BSS or BSS, data, and text segments into large pages. The library
 also comes with several userspace tools to help with huge page
 usability, environment setup, and control.
 .
 This package ships the library development files.

Description: Tools to ease use of hugetlbfs
 libhugetlbfs is a library which provides easy access to huge pages of
 memory. It is a wrapper for the hugetlbfs file system. Applications
 can use huge pages to fulfill malloc() requests without being
 recompiled by using LD_PRELOAD.
 .
 The package provies the following userspace tools to help with huge page
 usability, environment setup, and control:
 .
 hugeadm: Configure the system huge page pools.
 hugectl: Control policy for backing text, data and malloc() with hugepages.
 hugeedit: Set default policy for backing text and data with hugepages.
 pagesize: Print supported system page sizes.
